# **UIC Global Oculomics Initiative**

*Building the world’s first multimodal foundational model for oculoplastic and craniofacial disease.*

---

## Basics


The UIC Global Oculomics Initiative is a research program focused on developing large multimodal datasets and foundational models capable of supporting oculoplastic and craniofacial diagnosis, global screening, and clinical decision support. The project integrates three major pillars:

- **Comprehensive clinical data from UIC**, including full EHR histories, imaging archives, and curated multimodal cohorts.
- **Large-scale external datasets**, including millions of eye- and face-region images with automatically extracted periorbital measurements.
- **Global health deployments**, where standardized imaging and metadata collection are performed using the **[Glorbit](https://glorbit.app)** platform across diverse international sites.

By combining real-world clinical data, massive-scale pretraining datasets, and prospective global cohorts, this initiative aims to establish a reproducible foundation for next-generation oculoplastics AI.

## Website Overview

This site serves as the central hub for the UIC Global Oculomics Initiative. Each section includes milestone-based progress tracking to provide transparent, continuously updated insight into the status of the initiative.

It provides:

- A **[roadmap](roadmap.md)** outlining major research phases and milestones  
- Detailed descriptions of **[datasets](datasets.md)** under development  
- Documentation for **[global deployments](deployments.md)** and field workflows  
- Technical guides for the **[multimodal foundational model pipeline](foundational.md)**  
- A catalog of **[tools, repositories, and computational assets](assets.md)**  
- A complete **[publication pipeline and manuscript tracking system](publications.md)**  
- A structured framework for **[new collaborators](collaborate.md)** to get involved
